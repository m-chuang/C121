For this milestone, I worked on finishing the avatar page functionality. Specifically, I worked on completing the avatar dressing up functionality, so that all the hats, shirts, and shoes are currently working. In addition, I also was able to implement being able to save the current dress-up and also reverting all changes to the last previous saved dress-up. Exporting the ferret avatar as a png to be able to share has also been implemented. Matching the dressed-up ferret to the one users see in the main map page is also in progress. I have successfully been able to update the map page ferret avatar with a dressed-up ferret, but that ferret won't be linked to the one in the avatar page.
