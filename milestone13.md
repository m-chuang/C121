For this milestone, I worked on a more efficient way for Geo tracking. Our project now uses GPS in order to track the user's location. Our project is also now secure (uses only https). I also restructured our Firebase database to store the user's location and items in a more efficicent matter. Our firebase now structures data based on user id instead of entry id.

For this milestone, I began a system to keep track of a user's stats through Firebase. This system will ultimately implement the core functions of quest tracking, item tracking, and user progress. In addition to these changes, I began updating our website's overall UI. One common remark was that our website looked very "stock"-like. As such, i've begun to add small UI/UX changes starting with our home and registration pages, which you can find below.

For this milestone, I worked on finishing the avatar page functionality. Specifically, I worked on completing the avatar dressing up functionality, so that all the hats, shirts, and shoes are currently working. In addition, I also was able to implement being able to save the current dress-up and also reverting all changes to the last previous saved dress-up. Exporting the ferret avatar as a png to be able to share has also been implemented. Matching the dressed-up ferret to the one users see in the main map page is also in progress. I have successfully been able to update the map page ferret avatar with a dressed-up ferret, but that ferret won't be linked to the one in the avatar page.

I worked on displaying a "?" button that the user can click on the map page to see a popup of some starting information about the app. I also worked on writing some FAQ to display on our Help page.
