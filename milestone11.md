I worked on clearing up the map based on the user's location and on storing locations real time into Firebase. Now the user can only see the map cleared in locations he/she has already been in! The user can also see any points the he or she cleared in previous sessions.

For this milestone I was tasked with creating a visual representation for user stats. To do this, I looked online for ideas on how to implement a user "profile" page. I found score.js, a way to visualize a user's stats and data; right now a slider is in place to show the different ranks a user can attain.

For this milestone, I worked on being able to update the avatar on the avatar page. Right now, we can update a few specific hats, but the code to change any avatar is there. For the next milestone, I will try to get all the other avatars working.

I worked on the avatar dressup functionality. So far we are able to layer clothing items onto the base ferret avatar by using HTML5 canvas. The functionality to click on inventory items to change the avatar's clothes is in the works.

The map is cleared only for the 3 locations where I have been. I didn't move from my location during these sessions.

This is the user profile page depicting the user's stats. Right now a slider is in place so testers can see the different ranks that are attainable. More detail will be added in the future.
