I worked on clearing up the map based on the user's location and on storing locations real time into Firebase. Now the user can only see the map cleared in locations he/she has already been in! The user can also see any points the he or she cleared in previous sessions.

I worked on the avatar dressup functionality. So far we are able to layer clothing items onto the base ferret avatar by using HTML5 canvas. The functionality to click on inventory items to change the avatar's clothes is in the works.
