I changed the item markers from the default generic marker image to an image of a mystery present box. This was a UI feature requested from class feedback, so the marker images would match with the theme of the app more.

# Completed Features #
* **Location tracking:** The app visualizes where the user has visited by displaying points on a reverse heatmap. The green overlay represents areas not yet explored by the user, while the clear spots represent where the user has been while logged in to the app.
* **Avatar customization:** Users can select a hat, top, and shoes that they can use to dress up their personal ferret avatar. This customized ferret avatar also shows up at the user's current location on the map.
