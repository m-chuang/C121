For this milestone, I made several changes to the map interface and functionality. I disabled default UI controls as well as draggability. In addition, I loaded item markers through a custom geoJSON file for our map. Once this was complete, I updated our map homepage to take up the full screen with the navbar overlayed on top. I cleaned up our working files as well as made other UI/UX updates to the Quests (progress bar), Avatar (tab and item placeholders), and Help (FAQ) pages. I updated the map so that it would keep the user's current location centered on the page upon resize. Finally, I added additional item markers and updated their descriptions. I then added a button to the infowindows to pick up items when found.

For this milestone, I helped write a function that could randomly generate location data, so we could test out our map clearing functionality. In addition, I started working on creating the items for customizing your ferret. I currently have created 5 hats and 5 shoes using Adobe Illustrator.

This is a screenshot of what the map looks like when zoomed out; the total explored area and item markers can all be seen here. (This is a debug view that is not accessible for normal users). The reverse heatmap view and all of the items and their locations are new features that have been added since Milestone 7.
