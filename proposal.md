### Feedback Used  
1. The main feedback we received from classmates and the TA was to incorporate the map more in most of our storyboard ideas. We were initially thinking of ways to visualize geographical data, but with the feedback we thought more about how we would use a map with our ideas.

1. A lot of groups gave feedback that they would like to see something more “unique” that people can use besides resorting to a Google Maps feature. We decided to go for an app idea that is more like a “game”.

### Project Features  
Map with an overlay for unexplored areas and “cleared” locations based off of user data over time.

Users can collect souvenir-like items based on the kind of places they visit (food, parks, beaches), and they can use those items to customize their personal avatar.
