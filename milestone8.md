This is a paper prototype of the quest menu and its functionality. To get to this page, one must toggle the hamburger menu navigation bar and select "Quests". The page displays all quests that are currently available; progress can be made concurrently on different quests. There will be a visual display on the user's progress through a completion bar. In addition, there will be a toggle to display previously completed quests. Users will receive a prize or item upon completing a quest.

Here is another possible design of the Quests page. This time, each quest could be displayed as like a pie chart to represent the progress. There could also be a Filter option to filter by quest categories, such as Distance, Items, and Places. We are still planning the kind of quests we would like to display.

This is a prototype design for the stats page of our page. In this page, the user will be able to see more details about their performance. Although there is not really a way to 'beat the game', users can measure their performance by seeing how many objects they have collected and how many quests they have completed.

### Scott ###

This prototype is another design for the 'stats' page. It's aim is to provide a location for users to track data about themselves and their ferret. It lists key information like distance walked and % explored. This will also be where they can view their trophies earned and statistical data about themselves such as their averages and lifetime data. Lastly, they can share their data to their peers using the share feature.
