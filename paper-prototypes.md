The main page shows the map with unexplored areas overlayed with a grass pattern, and explored parts in a different color. The ferret avatar could be used to indicate the current location. The main menu buttons are located at the bottom. "Avatar" will go to a separate page where the user can customize their avatar. The "Settings" and "Quests" button will appear in a popup modal.

This is what the app will look like when you find an item. A popup will appear stating that you have acquired an item (ex: sunglasses). Unexplored areas will be represented by a layer of grass that will clear up once the user has traversed the area.
