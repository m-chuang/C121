### Ferret 
*Explore with us*

 Ferret is an exploration game centered around local point of interest discovery and user data tracking. We want people to be motivated to go out and explore, and our map's visual representation of places a user has been is unique to us. In addition to presenting a user with data, we have an avatar system featuring a ferret that you can dress up with items to collect based on locations you visit, such as flip flops for the beach.

Our map is unique in the sense that it is a "reverse heatmap" - rather than areas turning "hot" upon being visited like a traditional heatmap, the map starts off opaque and "cold" until a user has been physically present at the location. When a user has visited an area, the map becomes clear and is a visual representation of where a user has been - the goal for the user should be to clear the map completely! Along the way there are points of interest located around the map where users can collect items to dress up their ferret.

By displaying where a user has been before, we hope to have users explore new areas that they may have never known that existed. Our app gives incentive to who need the extra push to go out of their way to explore or those who have thought about exploring previously.
