What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
* We are creating a game to motivate people to go out and explore more local places.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* It is done today by being able to see the places you have visited before. However, beyond keeping track of where you have visited, there isn't much incentive to keep on exploring new places.

What’s new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
* Our approach is to gamify the exploration process. This will be a more successful approach to get people to explore because it will make exploring more fun by being able to collect items.

Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?
* With its progress tracking and item-collecting features, this game gives an incentive for people who have thought about exploring or already like exploring.
